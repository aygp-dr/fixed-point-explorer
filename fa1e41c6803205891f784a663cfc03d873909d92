Prompt: Add non-phony task for SVG to PNG conversion and include t-shirt design in README

Implementation:
- Added pattern rule %.png: %.svg using rsvg-convert
- Kept it simple per RFC #7 guidelines (one line, no conditionals)
- Created docs/images/tshirt-design.png from SVG
- Added image to README.org after overview text

Testing:
- rsvg-convert successfully created 15KB PNG from SVG
- Makefile pattern rule works for any future SVG files

Notes:
- ImageMagick's convert/magick had core dump issues
- rsvg-convert worked without issues
- Following principle: simple commands in Makefile, complex logic in scripts
