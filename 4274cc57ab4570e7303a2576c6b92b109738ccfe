Prompt: Commit the changes to SETUP.org so we baseline on what we had but then immediately
rm it and just note that we have now a working repo baseline so we don't need the scaffolding

Implementation:
- First committed SETUP.org updates to capture final state
- Then removed SETUP.org as it's no longer needed
- Project now maintains files directly without literate programming layer

Rationale:
- All content has been successfully tangled
- Direct file maintenance is simpler for ongoing development
- README.org provides all necessary documentation
- Scaffolding served its purpose for initial setup
