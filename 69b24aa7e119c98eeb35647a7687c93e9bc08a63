Prompt: Fix hardcoded versions, phony tasks, and use proper directory dependencies

Issues identified:
- Hardcoded version numbers in URLs
- .PHONY used for targets that create directories
- mkdir -p scattered instead of proper dependencies

Implementation:
- Added LEAN_ARCHIVE variable with pattern substitution
- Created $(TOOLS_DIR) as explicit target
- Used order-only prerequisites ( < /dev/null | ) for directories
- Removed .PHONY from directory-creating targets
- Made lean-tools an alias to $(LEAN_DIR)

Testing:
- gmake -n lean-tools shows "Nothing to be done" (directory exists)
- Variables properly expand: lean-$(LEAN_VERSION:v%=%) becomes lean-4.21.0
