Prompt: Fix the makefile so it uses gmake for MAKE and that help is the default target.
Make setup should download the tools for formal methods supporting this;
gmake deps should check that we have the required tools.
If there's any logic in the makefile move it to scripts/ with proper targets.

Implementation:
- Updated Makefile to use gmake explicitly with MAKE := gmake
- Set help as default target with .DEFAULT_GOAL := help
- Created scripts/deps.sh to check for Scheme implementations and tools
- Created scripts/setup.sh to install formal methods tools (Lean 4)
- Added self-documenting help with grep pattern matching
- Integrated Lean 4.21.0 installation from GitHub issue #1

Clarifications:
- Used ## comments for self-documenting help
- Scripts use portable sh instead of bash
- Added color output for better UX
- Included platform detection for OS-specific installation
