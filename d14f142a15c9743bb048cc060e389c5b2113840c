Prompt: Make sure the core code/examples in Guile Scheme runs and that the unit tests work
for that since it's my main setup.

Implementation:
- Fixed Y combinator to handle multiple arguments using apply
- Removed format dependency for compatibility
- Replaced hash tables with alists for portability
- Fixed implementation detection for Guile
- All display operations use primitive display/displayln

Tests:
- 14 tests covering fibonacci, list operations, and edge cases
- All tests pass on GNU Guile 3.0+
- Test framework provides clear pass/fail feedback

Issues resolved:
- Fixed infinite recursion in Y combinator
- Handled variable arity functions (append takes 2 args)
- Removed Guile-specific features from portable code
