Prompt: Port any needed commands from Makefile.lean to main Makefile

Context: Two Makefiles existed, wanted to consolidate

Testing:
- gmake lean-version: Shows Lean 4.21.0 and Lake 5.0.0
- gmake lean-test: Successfully runs #check (1 + 1 : Nat)
- Paths match actual installation in tools/formal-methods/lean

Implementation:
- Added lean-test, lean-check-compat, clean-lean targets
- Fixed LEAN_DIR to match reality (lean not lean4)
- Updated download to use wget matching actual history
- All targets tested and working
