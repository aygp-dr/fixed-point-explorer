Prompt: Add a reasonable .gitignore for this repo; also ignore .env since I might put secrets in that and I might have logs in logs/

Implementation:
- Created comprehensive .gitignore for multi-dialect Scheme project
- Included .env and logs/ as specifically requested
- Added patterns for compiled files from Guile, Chez, and Racket
- Included common editor, OS, and build artifacts
- Added REPL history files for all three Scheme implementations

Rationale:
- Prevents accidental commit of secrets (.env files)
- Excludes compiled artifacts that vary by platform
- Ignores editor temporary files for clean repository
- Protects user privacy (REPL history, logs)
