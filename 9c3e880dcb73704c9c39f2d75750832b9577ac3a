Prompt: Add wildcard exporter for markdown like %.md: %.org and gitignore README.md

Implementation:
- Added pattern rule %.md: %.org
- Uses Emacs batch mode with org-md-export-to-markdown
- Added README.md to .gitignore as it's generated

Testing:
- gmake README.md successfully created 7.7KB markdown file
- Conversion includes TOC and proper formatting

Rationale:
- Keep source in Org format (richer features)
- Generate Markdown for GitHub display
- Don't commit generated files
