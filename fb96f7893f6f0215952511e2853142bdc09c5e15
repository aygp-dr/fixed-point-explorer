Prompt: Add gmake emacs target that uses dirlocals or loads project support

Implementation:
- Added emacs-verify target to check configuration
- Added emacs target to start Emacs with project settings
- Moved all logic to scripts/emacs.sh per project convention
- Script detects project root for location independence

Purpose:
- Simplify Emacs/Geiser setup for developers
- Verify configuration is correct
- Launch with proper project settings loaded
