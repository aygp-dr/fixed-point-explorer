## Commit Message

```
feat(experiments): enhance elisp Y combinator with complete tangle/detangle workflow

- Add CONTINUE meta-jokes demonstrating AI programming concept
- Document real detangle debugging with tmux session discovery  
- Enhance with Mermaid diagram, safe Y combinator, type theory
- Add practical detangle example showing bidirectional sync
- Update lessons learned with process isolation insights
- Create GitHub issue #13 for presentation potential

Key discoveries:
- Detangle requires exclusive file access (no tmux sessions)
- Only syncs content within tangle markers, not additions after
- Batch operations blocked by active editing sessions

Perfect literate programming demonstration with real debugging!

## Important Notes

1. **Do NOT commit** if any tmux session has files open - check with `tmux ls`
2. The org file is the authoritative source - all elisp files are generated
3. GitHub issue #13 documents this as presentation material
4. All CONTINUE jokes reference the t-shirt in main repo README

## Verification Steps

Before committing:
```bash
cd experiments/2025-01-21-elisp-y-combinator
gmake tangle  # Regenerate all elisp files
gmake execute # Verify all code blocks work
grep -c CONTINUE *.el  # Should show CONTINUE in each file
```

## Context
This experiment demonstrates bidirectional literate programming with org-babel, including a real debugging session where we discovered tmux was blocking detangle operations. The CONTINUE meta-jokes add computational wordplay as a tribute to the AI programming concept.
