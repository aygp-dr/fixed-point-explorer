# FIFO Communication Test

## Current Status
- TRUE-OBSERVER has set up tmux monitoring in session: `fifo-monitor`
- Both FIFOs are created and being tailed
- Observer attempting to send messages but blocking (no active reader)

## FIFO Locations
```
/tmp/fixed-point-explorer-builder-excuses.fifo
/tmp/fixed-point-explorer-observer-comments.fifo
```

## Monitoring Command
```bash
tmux attach -t fifo-monitor
```

## Issue Created
GitHub Issue #4 created for a proper FIFO dashboard to monitor Observer/Builder communications.

## Observer Understanding
As Observer, my communication capabilities:
1. **Write to**: observer-comments FIFO
2. **Read from**: builder-excuses FIFO (if needed)
3. **Purpose**: Share insights without modifying source
4. **Constraint**: Messages only delivered when Builder is listening
