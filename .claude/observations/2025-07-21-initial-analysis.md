# Observation: 2025-07-21 - Initial Project Analysis

## Summary
Fixed-point-explorer is a literate programming project exploring Y combinator implementations across multiple Scheme dialects. The project is in its inception phase with comprehensive specifications in SETUP.org but no tangled source code yet.

## Details

### Key Patterns Noticed
- **Literate Programming Approach**: All source code embedded in SETUP.org using org-babel
- **Multi-dialect Support**: Designed for Guile, Chez Scheme, and Racket with portable core
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear distinction between portable and implementation-specific code
- **Test-Driven**: Includes test framework and integration tests from the start
- **Emacs-centric**: Deep Geiser integration for REPL development

### Project Architecture
```
src/
├── portable/      # Cross-implementation Y combinator, fibonacci, list operations
├── guile/         # Guile-specific extensions (timing, macros)
├── chez/          # Chez-specific optimizations (case-lambda)
└── racket/        # Racket-specific features (contracts, types, tracing)
```

### Interesting Approaches
1. **Y Combinator Variations**: 
   - Y-explicit (basic self-application)
   - Y-chez (optimized with case-lambda)
   - Y-typed (Racket with type annotations)

2. **Test Infrastructure**: Simple but effective test framework with assertion counts
3. **Performance Considerations**: Memoized fibonacci implementation included
4. **Build System**: Make-based with targets for each Scheme implementation

### Current State
- Repository initialized with GitHub remote
- No commits yet (pristine state)
- Standard GitHub labels present
- No issues created
- experiments/ folder now created for tracking work

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Tangle SETUP.org** to generate the actual source files
2. **Run init-project.sh** to create directory structure
3. **Test the setup** with `make test` to ensure all implementations work
4. **Create initial commit** with the tangled files

### Future Considerations
1. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Add GitHub Actions for multi-implementation testing
2. **Documentation**: Consider generating API docs from docstrings
3. **Benchmarking**: Expand benchmark suite beyond fibonacci
4. **Formal Verification**: The tools/formal-methods directory suggests interest in formal proofs
5. **Observer/Meta Labels**: Create GitHub labels for observer insights and meta-discussions

### Questions for Development Team
1. Why was Y-explicit chosen as the base implementation over other formulations?
2. Are there plans to extend beyond the three Scheme dialects?
3. What role will the formal-methods tools play in the project?
4. Should the experiments/ folder have a specific structure or convention?

## Technical Debt Markers
None found yet - project hasn't been implemented. However, the SETUP.org contains:
- Format compatibility notes between implementations
- Warning about Lean installation on FreeBSD
- Notes about hash-table portability between Scheme dialects
