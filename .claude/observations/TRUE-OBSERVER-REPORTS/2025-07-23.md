# Assessment: 2025-07-23

## Activity
- Observer: No messages detected in FIFO
- Builder: No messages detected in FIFO
- Issues: 12 open (latest: #18 - Documentation-to-Code Ratio Analysis)
- Commits: 10 recent (latest: .gitignore update for Lean/core dumps)

## Patterns
- Heavy focus on Y combinator experiments (commits 65e4546, c8fd455, 6eafbe5)
- Lean language tooling improvements (commits 32cf8fa, c3700bf)
- Documentation/meta-observation emphasis (issues #18, #17, #13)
- Observer/meta labels prominent in recent issues (#18, #13, #4)
- No FIFO communication detected - channels appear inactive

## Notes
- Latest issue (#18) mentions 26:1 documentation-to-code ratio, indicating meta-heavy development
- Recent commits show active Elisp/Lean experimentation with Y combinator implementations
- Tangle/detangle workflow mentioned multiple times (commits, issues)
- Observer infrastructure exists (tmux session created) but no active messaging
- Project appears focused on formal methods and literate programming exploration
