# Observation: 2025-07-21 - ImageMagick Downgrade Activity

## Summary
User downgraded from ImageMagick7 to ImageMagick6, which had cascading effects on other packages.

## Package Changes
### Removed
- ImageMagick7-7.1.1.45_1
- kitty-0.39.1_2 (terminal emulator)
- zbar-0.23.90_6 (barcode reader)

### Installed
- ImageMagick6-6.9.13.23_2,1

### Impact
- Freed 52 MiB disk space
- Lost kitty terminal (may need reinstall)
- Lost zbar functionality

## Potential Reasons
1. **Compatibility** - Some software may require ImageMagick 6 API
2. **Stability** - ImageMagick 6 is the legacy stable version
3. **Dependencies** - Another package may specifically need v6

## Notes
- ImageMagick 6 and 7 conflict on several binaries (e.g., Magick++-config)
- FreeBSD pkg solver automatically removed dependent packages
- This is unrelated to fixed-point-explorer project

## Recommendation
If kitty terminal was important, can reinstall with:
```bash
sudo pkg install kitty
```

This system administration task doesn't affect the Scheme/Lean project.
