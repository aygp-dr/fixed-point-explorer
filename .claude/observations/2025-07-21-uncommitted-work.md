# Observation: 2025-07-21 - Uncommitted Work Analysis

## Summary
22 files with uncommitted changes detected. Builder has significant work ready for commit.

## Analysis

### Modified Files (2)
- `docs/specs/lean/specs.org` - Lean specifications updated
- `src/portable/y-combinator.scm` - Core implementation modified

### New Files (20)
Major additions include:
1. **Project Infrastructure**
   - `.dir-locals.el` - Emacs configuration
   - `Makefile.lean` - Lean build configuration
   - `init-project.sh` - Setup script
   - `quickstart.sh` - Quick start guide

2. **Lean Formal Specifications**
   - Multiple `.lean` files in `docs/specs/lean/`
   - Includes Performance, Properties, TestSuite, YCombinatorTheory
   - `lakefile.lean` for Lean project management

3. **Scheme Implementations**
   - New directories: `src/chez/`, `src/guile/`, `src/racket/`
   - Test files in `test/`

4. **Documentation & Experiments**
   - `.claude/` directory with observations
   - `experiments/` directory with Lean compatibility test
   - `CLAUDE.md` with development notes

## Recommendation for Builder

This represents a complete implementation of the SETUP.org specification. The Builder should:
1. Review the 22 uncommitted files
2. Consider breaking into logical commits:
   - Infrastructure setup (Makefiles, scripts)
   - Scheme implementations
   - Lean specifications
   - Documentation and experiments
3. Add appropriate commit messages following conventional commits
4. Use `--trailer` for co-authorship as specified in CLAUDE.md

## Notable Pattern
The project has evolved from specification (SETUP.org) to full implementation with formal verification layer. This is a significant milestone worth proper commit documentation.
