# Observation: 2025-07-21 - ImageMagick SVG Core Dump Root Cause

## Summary
Isolated the exact failure point: ImageMagick 7.1.1-45 crashes when using librsvg2-rust-2.60.0_3 to process SVG files on FreeBSD.

## Technical Details

### Working Scenarios
1. **rsvg-convert standalone**: ✅ Perfect
   - `rsvg-convert input.svg -o output.png`
   - librsvg2-rust works fine on its own

2. **ImageMagick inline SVG**: ✅ Sometimes works
   - `echo '<svg>...</svg>' | magick svg:- output.png`
   - Suggests the issue is file-based

3. **All non-SVG formats**: ✅ Perfect
   - WebP, PNG, JPG, GIF, PPM, ICO, XPM, etc.
   - Even complex operations (animations, multi-resolution)

### Failing Scenario
- **ANY** SVG file operation through ImageMagick
- Immediate abort trap (core dump)
- Happens before any processing begins

## Root Cause Analysis
This is a known integration issue between:
- ImageMagick 7.1.1-45 (C/C++)
- librsvg2-rust-2.60.0_3 (Rust-based SVG renderer)

The Rust/C FFI boundary appears to be the problem, possibly related to:
- Memory management differences
- Thread safety issues
- Signal handler conflicts

## Impact on Project
Minimal - fixed-point-explorer doesn't require SVG processing. The experiment successfully identified:
1. A specific bug in the FreeBSD package
2. Easy workarounds (use rsvg-convert directly)
3. All other ImageMagick features work perfectly

## Khoj's Interpretation
The AI-generated scene beautifully captured the debugging session:
- Frustrated notes about "SVG core dumps"
- Clear visualization of the test matrix (✓ and ✗)
- FreeBSD daemon mascot as environmental storytelling
- The experimental nature of the workspace

This demonstrates both the power of ImageMagick (when it works) and the importance of thorough testing across formats.
