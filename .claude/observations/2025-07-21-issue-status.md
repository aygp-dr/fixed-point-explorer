## Patterns
1. **Quick turnaround**: Issue #1 created and closed same day
2. **Observer-created**: 4/6 issues have 'observer' label
3. **Enhancement focus**: Most issues improve developer experience
4. **Clear specifications**: Issues include detailed implementation plans

## Recommendation
All open issues remain valid and unimplemented. Issue #3 (Chez tests) might be blocking full multi-dialect support.
