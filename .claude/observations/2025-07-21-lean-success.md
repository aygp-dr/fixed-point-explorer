# Observation: 2025-07-21 - Lean Integration Success

## Summary
Successfully integrated Lean 4 formal verification with the fixed-point-explorer project, creating parallel implementations of the Scheme functions.

## Key Achievement

### Parallel Implementation
The `docs/specs/lean/Fibonacci.lean` file implements:
1. **Fibonacci function** - matching the Scheme Y combinator version
2. **List operations** - myAppend, myLength, myMap, myFilter
3. **Test cases** - identical to Scheme tests
4. **Formal proofs** - beginning with `append_empty` theorem

### Test Results Match
```
Scheme (from SETUP.org):        Lean:
fib(0) = 0                     #eval fib 0   -- 0
fib(1) = 1                     #eval fib 1   -- 1
fib(5) = 5                     #eval fib 5   -- 5
fib(10) = 55                   #eval fib 10  -- 55
fib(20) = 6765                 #eval fib 20  -- 6765
```

## Architecture Insight

This creates an interesting project structure:
```
fixed-point-explorer/
├── src/                       # Y combinator implementations
│   ├── portable/              # Cross-Scheme implementation
│   └── {guile,chez,racket}/   # Dialect-specific
├── docs/specs/lean/           # Formal specifications
│   └── Fibonacci.lean         # Lean proofs
└── tools/formal-methods/lean/ # Lean 4 toolchain
```

## Recommendations

### 1. Create Y Combinator in Lean
While Lean uses structural recursion by default, implementing Y combinator would be educational:
```lean
-- YCombinator.lean
-- Encoding Y combinator in Lean's type system
```

### 2. Property-Based Testing Bridge
Link Scheme implementations to Lean proofs:
- Generate test cases from Lean
- Verify Scheme results against Lean specifications

### 3. Formal Verification Goals
- Prove termination for all recursive functions
- Verify equivalence between different Y combinator formulations
- Prove optimizations preserve semantics

### 4. Documentation Integration
Update `docs/specs/types.org` to include Lean type signatures alongside the informal specifications.

## Technical Notes

- Lean uses `/` for installation path: `tools/formal-methods/lean/`
- Binary works perfectly via Linux compatibility
- No performance issues observed
- Lean's `#eval` provides immediate feedback like a REPL

## Future Experiments

1. **Performance comparison**: Lean vs Scheme implementations
2. **Code extraction**: Generate Scheme from Lean proofs
3. **Interactive theorem proving**: Step-by-step Y combinator derivation
